This project is a demonstration of an online shop that sells pre-built gaming PCs and accessories. It lists a select number of high quality products for sale in a visually impressive way. Customers can browse the inventory in its entirety or by category, examine individual products in detail, add items to the cart, and go through the checkout process.  

This website is built using React with TypeScript, and it contains 3 key features of e-commerce sites:
1. An effective landing page that encourages customer conversion or action.
2. A product list page featuring a category filter that is clearly defined easy to use.
3. A convenient cart and checkout system that makes purchasing easy.

The main challenge for this project was incorporating the Bootstrap CSS framework to create a mobile-first responsive web app that adjusts well to a variety of screen sizes. A secondary goal was to combine React with TypeScript to create a robust app that is less likely to produce runtime errors.
